# Tuprware Node

## uOCyberSec's open-source challenge container management software. 

### Deployed on our challenge nodes in the cloud. ☁️

### [Documentation](https://github.com/uocybersec/tuprware-node/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Installation:
1. You must clone the repo in the `/` directory (or at least somewhere that can make the repo readable by all users). 
1. Run `./setup.sh` to install dependencies and set up the machine as a Tuprware node. The script will at some point ask you to logout and log back in to run the script again.
2. To start the application from here on out, run `./start_node.sh`.
